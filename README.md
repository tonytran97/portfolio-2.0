# Portfolio 2.0

## Description

---

Hey, my name is Tony Tran!

I recently decided on a career switch from healthcare over to becoming a web developer. After devoting a significant amount of my academic career and life to pursing medicine, I have finally discovered my passion for web development and technology. I look forward to creating new projects and learning more about what this field has to offer. This new version of my portfolio was built using React.
